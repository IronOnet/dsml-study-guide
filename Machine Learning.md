### Regression versus Classification


## Algorithms


## Classification

### Class Imbalances

If we build a model on an imbalanced dataset, the model may predict the majority call all the time (which could lead to high acuracy - misleading). 

Methods:
1. Oversampling - Repeat data for minority class until it is balaned with the majority class.
