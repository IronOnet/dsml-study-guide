## Theory

### Regression versus Classification


## Algorithms


## Classification

### Class Imbalances

If we build a model on an imbalanced dataset, the model may predict the majority call all the time (which could lead to high acuracy - misleading). 

Methods:
Method 1: Oversampling 

1. Random - Repeat data for minority class until it is balaned with the majority class. 
	
2. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) - Similar to KNN, Create a new point in minority class that is between two nearest neighbors
	
3. ADAptive SYNthetic oversampling (ADASYN)
