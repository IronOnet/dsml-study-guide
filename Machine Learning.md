## Algorithms


## Classification

### Class Imbalances

If we build a model on an imbalanced dataset, the model may predict the majority call all the time (which could lead to high acuracy - misleading). 

Methods:
1. Oversampling - Repeat data for minority class until it is balaned with the majority class. 
	a. Random
	b. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) - Similr to KNN, Create a new point in minority class that is between two points
	c.
