### Complexity

#### Time Complexity

**What is it?** [Resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)
* runtime (of algorithm)- function of the size of the input
* rate of growth of run time - how fast fuction grows with the input size

==Big O== - how long algorithm takes in terms of the size of it's input (time)
1. different steps get added
2. drop constants 
3.  Different inputs => diffferent variables 
![Example of Naming Variables for Big O](https://photos.google.com/album/AF1QipPfjm3PHBCiN_eT1T8CAOtzKh6txR99WmTXPr93/photo/AF1QipO6ti8ZlIrT-mqBlEtWesSHBGwYwH0puYWkqJxw)
4. drop non-dominate terms 
Example: O(n<sup>2</sup>) > O(n)

Note: the specifics (processor, memory, 32/64 bit) of the machine are not considered
